const threatDetectionData = sampleDataService.getDataForAgent('threat_detection');
const incidentAnalysisData = sampleDataService.getDataForAgent('incident_analysis');
```

#### **For Dashboard Integration**
```typescript
// Get comprehensive statistics
const stats = sampleDataService.getStatistics();

// Get recent activity
const recentActivity = sampleDataService.getRecentActivity(24); // Last 24 hours

// Search functionality
const searchResults = sampleDataService.searchSecurityEvents('malware');
```

### Data Structure

#### **Security Event Schema**
```typescript
interface SecurityEvent {
  id: string;
  timestamp: string;
  source: string;
  type: string;
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  description: string;
  source_ip: string;
  destination_ip: string;
  port: number;
  protocol: string;
  action: string;
  rule_id: string;
  user: string;
  location: string;
  tags: string[];
}
```

#### **Threat Indicator Schema**
```typescript
interface ThreatIndicator {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  value: string;
  description: string;
  confidence: number;
  source: string;
  first_seen: string;

  priority: 'low' | 'normal' | 'high' | 'urgent' | 'critical';
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
  assigned_to: string;
  affected_systems: string[];
  source_ips: string[];
  tags: string[];
  timeline: Array<{
    timestamp: string;
    event: string;
    description: string;
    agent: string;
  }>;
  indicators: string[];
  related_events: string[];
  resolution: ResolutionData | null;
}
```

### Customizing Sample Data

#### **Adding New Events**
1. Edit `data/sample/security_events.json`
2. Add new event objects following the schema
3. Restart the application to load new data

#### **Adding New Incidents**
1. Edit `data/sample/incidents.json`
2. Add new incident objects with complete timeline
3. Link to existing events and indicators

#### **Adding New Indicators**
1. Edit `data/sample/threat_indicators.json`
2. Add new indicator objects with appropriate metadata
3. Ensure confidence and severity levels are realistic

### Data Sources and References

The sample data is inspired by real-world cybersecurity scenarios and common attack patterns:

- **OWASP Top 10** for web application security issues
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** for attack techniques and tactics
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** for incident response procedures
- **Common attack vectors** like SQL injection, malware, privilege escalation
- **Realistic network topologies** and IP address ranges
- **Common security tools** and their log formats

### Performance Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: Sample data is loaded once and cached in memory
- **Query Performance**: Optimized data structures for fast lookups
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle larger datasets if needed
- **Caching**: Statistics are cached and updated only when needed

### Troubleshooting

#### **Data Not Loading**
- Check that JSON files are valid
- Verify file paths in `sampleDataService.ts`
- Check browser console for errors

#### **Missing Data in Dashboard**
- Ensure sample data service is properly imported
- Check that statistics are being calculated correctly
- Verify agent integration is working

#### **Performance Issues**
- Consider reducing sample data size for development
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Use search filters to limit displayed data
